# JSON-LD_BioThings_API_DEMO

This github repo serves as a code domo for paper 'Cross-linking BioThings APIs through JSON-LD to facilitate knowledge exploration. In this paper, we have implemented JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD) technology on the BioThings APIs that we have developed, MyGene.info, MyVariant.info and MyChem.info. JSON-LD provides a standard way to add semantic context to the existing JSON data structure, for the purpose of enhancing the interoperability between APIs. We demonstrated several use cases that were facilitated by semantic annotations using JSON-LD, including simpler and more precise query capabilities as well as API cross-linking.
